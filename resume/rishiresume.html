Integration with a payment gateway for secure transactions.
Admin panel for managing inventory, user accounts, and orders.
Responsive design for seamless user experience across devices.
<h3>Technologies:</h3> Java, Spring Framework (Spring Boot, Spring Security), Hibernate (or another ORM tool), HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Thymeleaf (or another templating engine), MySQL (or another relational database), RESTful APIs, Bootstrap (or another front-end framework).

<h2>Project 2:Task Management Application:</h2>

<h3>Description:</h3> Build a task management application to help users organize and track their tasks. Users should be able to create tasks, set deadlines, prioritize tasks, and mark tasks as completed.
<h3>Key Features:</h3>
User authentication and registration.
CRUD operations for tasks, including creating, updating, and deleting tasks.
Task filtering and sorting based on attributes like priority, deadline, and status.
