<h2><strong>1945</strong> <br></h2>
<br>
Vannevar Bush writes <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/flashbks/computer/bushf.htm"target="blank">an article</a> in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/world/"target="blank">Atlantic Monthly</a> about a 
photo-electrical-mechanical device called a Memex, for memory 
extension, which could make and follow links between documents 
on microfiche <br>
<br>
<h2><strong>1960s</strong><br></h2>
<br>
Doug Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which 
does hypertext browsing editing, email, and so on. He invents
 the mouse for this purpose. See the <a href="http://www.bootstrap.org/library.htm"target="blank">Bootstrap Institute library.</a> <br>

Ted Nelson coins the word Hypertext in <em> A File Structure for the Complex,
    the Changing, and the Indeterminate.</em> 20th National Conference, New York,
  <a href="https://www.acm.org/"target="blank">Association for Computing Machinery</a>, 1965. See also: Literary Machines.
   Note: There used to be a link here to "Hypertext and Hypermedia: 
   A Selected Bibliography" by Terence Harpold, but the site hosting
    the resource did not maintain the link.,<br>

Andy van Dam and others build the Hypertext Editing System and FRESS
 in 1967. <br>
 <br>

<h2><strong>1980</strong> <br></h2>
While consulting for CERN June-December of 1980, Tim Berners-Lee 
writes a notebook program, "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything", 
which allows links to be made between arbitrary nodes. 
Each node had a title, a type, and a list of bidirectional typed links. 
"ENQUIRE" ran on Norsk Data machines under SINTRAN-III. See: <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1980/Enquire/scaled/"target="blank">Enquire
